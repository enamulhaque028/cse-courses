Reading Assignment-1: Read “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits” by Gordon Moore

Answer the following question:
 - One of the potential problems which Moore raises (and
dismisses) is heat. Do you agree with Moore's conclusions?
Eit ehr just yif or re ute f Moo e s r ' co c us o s nclusions.
 - A popular misconception of Moore's law is that it states that
the speed of computers increases exponentially, however, that
is not what Moore foretells in this p pa er.

Explain what Moore's law actually says based on this paper.
