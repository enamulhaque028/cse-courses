1. Preliminary investigation
   - Determine if a new system is needed
   - Three primary tasks:
     - suggest alternative solution
     - define problem: by observation and interview what info is needed by whom, when, where and why
     - prepare a short report: **feasibility report**, **project plan**
2. System|requirement analysis
   - Expand "Preliminary investigation": Study depth on previous sys. and determine what the new system do
   - Use tools
     - Checklist: list of questions
     - Sequencial flow chart
     - Grid charts: to show relationships between inputs and outputs
     - Top-down analysis
   - Produce documentation
     - Complete docs about current system problems: FRD|SRS or BRD
     - Gantt chart: Possible development schedule
     - New sys. requirements: Subject, scope, objectives, benefits 
   - Listen to customers | users demand
   - Write storybook, usecases, sequence diagram
   
3. Design
   - Design from technical view
   - UX & UI & Architectural design
   - System design report
     - Inputs/Outputs
     - Processing
     - Storage and backup
4. Development
   - from sketch
   - use others services
   - acquire hardware
   - Testing
     - Module | Unit test: part by part test
     - Intregration test: All parts at once
5. Implementation
   - Upgrade from old version
   - Install new version & provide training
6. Operation & maintenance: 
   - Daily observation
   - Periodic evaluation & update
